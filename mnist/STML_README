I'm running these on niagara.
There are 4 relevant scripts:
 - STML.py : experiment script
 - make_niagara_launcher.py : creates STML_launcher.sh
 - niagara_launcher.sh : run many copies of STML_launch_helper.sh on STML.py with different args
 - niagara_launch_helper.sh : run a single experiment

 These naming conventions are bad.
 They are inherited from myopic_agents
